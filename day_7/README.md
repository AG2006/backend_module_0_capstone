## Day 7

1. Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository - if you followed the suggested directory structure from the setup, you should be able to run the following command from your home directory `cd turing/prework`. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository.

1. Using what you have learned in the last week, complete at least one of the projects below.  Put any files related to the project(s) you choose in a day_7 directory.

    1. [FizzBuzz](./day_7/fizzbuzz.md)
    1. [10 Little Monkeys](./day_7/10_little_monkeys.md)
    1. [Ceasar Cipher](./day_7/ceasar_cipher.md)
    1. [Checker Board](./day_7/checker_board.md)

1. When you are finished with your project(s), use your terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local git repository and push your work to the remote repository on GitHub:

    1. Use `git add day_7/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
    1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
    1. `$ git commit -m "Adds Day 7 Work"`
    1. `$ git push origin master`

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
