## Day 2

1. Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository - if you followed the suggested directory structure from the setup, you should be able to run the following command from your home directory `cd turing/prework`. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository.

1. Work through the [Arrays](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#7.-arrays) section of Ruby in 100 Minutes. As you work through this section, research each of the methods mentioned by looking through the Ruby docs for [Arrays](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.1/Array.html);  in the day_2/array_methods.md file, describe what each method does.

1. Work through the following lessons from Learn Ruby the Hard Way.  In the day_2 directory you will see a file called lrthw_notes.md - this is where you can put the answers to any questions or reflections from the lessons.

    1. [Booleans](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex27.html) - just read through this lesson, you do not need to memorize anything, or create flashcards(unless you _really_ want to).
    2. [Boolean Practice](https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex28.html)

1. Work through the exercise.rb file in the day_2 directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_2 directory.

1. When you are finished with all of the day_2 activities, use your terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local git repository and push your work to the remote repository on GitHub:

    1. `$ git add day_2/exercises.rb`
    1. `$ git add day_2/questions.md`
    1. `$ git add day_2/lrthw_notes.md`
    1. Use `git add day_2/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
    1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
    1. `$ git commit -m "Adds Day 2 Work"`
    1. `$ git push origin master`

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
