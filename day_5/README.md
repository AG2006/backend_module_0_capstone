## Day 5

1. Using your terminal, open the local copy of the repository that you created during setup.  To do this, you will need to use the terminal command `cd` to change into the directory that holds the repository - if you followed the suggested directory structure from the setup, you should be able to run the following command from your home directory `cd turing/prework`. Once you are in the correct directory, use the terminal command `atom .` to open the prework repository.

1. Work through the [What Are Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#whatareobjects) and [Classes Defining Objects](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/the_object_model#classesdefineobjects) sections of the Object Model Lesson from LaunchSchool. Any files that you create while working through this lesson can be kept in the day_5 directory.

1. Work through the [Classes and Objects Part 1](https://launchschool.com/books/oo_ruby/read/classes_and_objects_part1) lesson from LaunchSchool.

1. Work through the [Objects, Attributes and Methods](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html#11.-objects,-attributes,-and-methods) lesson from Ruby in 100 Minutes. Any files that you create while working through this lesson can be kept in the day_5 directory.

1. Work through the exercise.rb file in the day_5 directory.

1. Answer the questions in the questions.md file in the day_5 directory.

1. When you are finished with all of the day_5 activities, use your terminal to run the following commands in order to save your work to your local git repository and push your work to the remote repository on GitHub:

    1. `$ git add day_5/exercises.rb`
    1. `$ git add day_5/questions.md`
    1. Use `git add day_5/<filename>` to add all additional files that you created today
    1. `$ git status` - you should see only green filenames - if you see any that are red, continue to `git add` those files until `git status` shows all green files.
    1. `$ git commit -m "Adds Day 5 Work"`
    1. `$ git push origin master`

You should now be able to log in to GitHub, navigate to your remote prework repository and see all the work you did today!
